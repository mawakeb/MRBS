### **Task Description**

* Task 1: Setup multi-Gradle
    * Priority: high, because we need the setup to work on any code
* Task 2: Connect to databases from Amazon server
    * Priority: medium, because we need the databases, but we don’t need them immediately for basic tasks like setting up endpoints 
* Task 3: Make draft architecture and write a 3-page description of it for Assignment 1 Task 1
    * Priority: high, the deadline is until Friday, 26th of November
    * Upload to root/doc directory before the deadline
    * Send to TA for feedback



## **Main Problems Encountered**

**Problem 1**

Description: We couldn’t get the student account on Amazon 

Reaction: We couldn’t link the databases, so we have to ask the TA about it

**Problem 2**

Description: Conflicting advice for the multi-Gradle set up on the internet

Reaction: We messed up a couple of times and had to revert and reset a lot of work, we eventually went in the right direction and with some questions to the TA to check if what we were doing was right we managed to do it.

**Problem 3**

Description: We didn’t know there was a hard deadline on the draft architecture and there was a lack of guidance on how it should look like

Reaction: We rushed to meet the deadline



## **Adjustments for the next Sprint Plan**

Since we were a little lost on how we should do the draft architecture, we didn’t have much progress this week. We think we should definitely assign actual features next week to start building the services

We couldn’t use Amazon AWS to link the databases, so we should either get the student account or use another service to set it up.
